## Overview
This project uses Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze retail and economic datasets.  
The goal was to identify **sales trends, store-type performance, and macroeconomic factors (CPI & unemployment)** over time.

## Data & Methods
- **Tool:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts)  
- **Time Variable:** Weekly (X-axis in all charts)  
- **Datasets/Measures:**
  - Weekly Sales – Sum of sales across stores  
  - Store Type – Comparison of sales by store category  
  - CPI – Consumer Price Index trends over time  
  - Unemployment – Weekly unemployment trend  

## Visualizations
- **Weekly Sales Trend:** Identified seasonal spikes and stable long-term trend (~$45M–$50M).  
- **Store Type Sales:** Compared store performance based on category.  
- **CPI Over Time:** Highlighted volatility in weekly CPI values.  
- **Unemployment Trend:** Showed short-term fluctuations with no clear long-term trend.  

## Insights
- Weekly data is highly volatile → monthly/quarterly aggregation improves clarity.  
- Sales data shows **seasonal spikes** (likely linked to promotions/holidays).  
- CPI and Unemployment at weekly frequency are **too noisy**, but useful for spotting short-term shocks.
